# Yulia's Selection
## A selection of the best recordings of Classical music Masterpieces

This repo holds both the data and the presentation files of a list of classical music recordings.
This list is a subjective selection of recordings from classical music legacy.

### Technical details

The data is in JSon format, and the GUI layer uses [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) and [Stylus](https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/)
for templating and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for presentation.
[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is used for building.
